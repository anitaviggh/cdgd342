    <div id="wrapper">
        <h2 id="#overview">Overview</h2>
        <p>WebAdvisor is a student portal software solution created by Ellucian that is accessible over the web. It is currently the student portal system used by Massachusetts College of Art and Design. Students can use MassArt’s WebAdvisor, known as DaVinci, to check their schedule, see their grades, register for classes, and more. Due to a lack of competition and its company owning other student portal software that they pay more attention to updating, WebAdvisor has fallen severely behind with new technologies, and also has issues with usability in general. </p>
        <p>In this report, we will be focusing on the process of using DaVinci to access a student’s program evaluation. A program evaluation is a summary of all the classes a student has taken, alongside their grade and credits earned, as well as a list of classes that they still need to take in order to meet the requirements of their degree. It is accessed by logging in, clicking either of the two Program Evaluation links on the Student Menu, entering your settings, and clicking submit.</p>

        <p>WebAdvisor has barely any support on mobile devices. The closest it comes is a banner message warning users that auto capitalization on phones could cause problems when logging in, but because this warning appears on desktop too, it’s safe to assume the program doesn’t have any responsive functionality whatsoever across devices. When you load the page, it is extremely zoomed out, and you must spend time zooming in to read or access anything. Many of the links, especially on the student menu page, are too close together to work well with fingers on touch screens, which can cause mistakes.</p>

        <p>Because several methods were often used at once, they will be discussed in groups.</p>
        <p>The TESTING section will include methods that analyze the user’s actions and thoughts while going through the WebAdvisor workflow. These are Time-Lapse Video, Fly on the Wall, Narration, and Flow Analysis.</p>
        <p>The DISCUSSION section will include methods used to probe the user’s thoughts about their experience after the fact. These are Five Whys, Long-ranged Forecasting, Scenarios, and any additional relevant comments they made.</p>
        <p>All the results from Informance, which analyzed my thoughts instead of the users, will be discussed separately.</p>

        <h2>Subject #1: Jerry</h2>
        <p>Jerry is an applied math major currently attending Harvard University. His interests include computer science and economics, and he confesses to knowing nothing about design. He has never used WebAdvisor before.</p>
        
        <h3>Testing</h3>
        <!-- embed video -->
        
        <p>The movements of Jerry’s mouse suggest that he had some trouble with the navigation and workflow. He often bounced back and forth between links, unsure which to press. He spent some time clicking between the student menu and the main menu trying to find the links, and was confused by the fact that there were two links to Program Evaluation, but once he found that they lead to the same place, he made it through the settings screen and arrived at the program evaluation with ease. </p>
        <p>At this point, he said "I have no idea what I'm doing," and confessed that he wasn’t sure what an academic evaluation even was. His first assumption was that it involved evaluating the performance of your teachers. The actual academic evaluation is what he would have called a transcript. </p>
        <p>He liked the layout of the academic evaluation page. The color and boxes made it easy for him to tell which things were what. The page is very clear about which classes satisfy which requirements. He was surprised by the inclusion of classes I hadn’t taken yet, but thought it was useful, more useful than his school transcript.</p>
        
        <h3>Discussion</h3>
        
        <p>My 5 Why questions focused on what he thought of the structure of the menus, since I always had trouble with those and I wanted to know if he felt similarly. Specifically I focused on the separation of the main menu and student menu. He thought that the main menu/student menu structure was useful because it separated the student options from employee options in an intuitive way. After many why questions I discovered that he prefers hierarchical navigation systems because they make sense. </p>

        <p>When asked how future technology might affect how WebAdvisor functions, he said that it won’t be able to keep up with touch screens, and that it would be a pain to use on one in its current form. He showed me the application that Harvard uses on his tablet. It featured many more icons than WebAdvisor and had large areas to press for connivence when using a finger.</p>

        <p>When asked to think of a scenario that a person might use the program evaluation in, he said a student checking their grades in past classes.</p>
        
        <h2>Subject #2: Eva</h2>
        
        <p>Eva is a junior currently attending MassArt and majoring in graphic design. She has used DaVinci many times in the past. </p>
        
        <h3>Testing</h3>
        
        <p>When going to the program evaluation page, Eva didn’t fumble at all, finding the links immediately and going straight to where she needed to be. The navigation didn’t seem to confuse her, but this might be because she’s used to it.</p>
        
        <p>Eva felt that, in general, WebAdvisor’s layout was organized, but not too organized. She expressed a lot of issues with the font size, saying that some headings were way to large while others were way too small. The visual hierarchy was skewed because of it, making it difficult to focus. She also felt that everything was too crowded and she had to scroll too much to find what she wanted. The only positive thing she had to say while narrating is that the color coding on the complete and incomplete classes was obvious and easily understood.</p>
        
        <h3>Discussion</h3>
        
        <p>For the 5 whys, I asked Eva more about why she felt the page was crowded. She said that there was no breathing space, which made it hard to read and find the information she was looking for. This meant that she couldn’t accomplish the task she came to the site to do as easily, which is to find information related to her schedule and classes. The page needs to be spaced out, with more emphasis given on the relevant information.</p>
        
        <p>When asked how future technology might affect how WebAdvisor functions, she said that it would be terrible to use on a touchscreen because the links are too close together, especially on the student menu page. </p>
        
        <p>When asked to think of a scenario that a person might use the program evaluation in, she said a student who wants to see what credits they’ve earned and what they still need so they can register for the correct classes next semester.</p>
        
        
        <h2>Subject #3: Hakim</h2>

        <p>Hakim is a junior currently attending MassArt and majoring in graphic design. He has used DaVinci many times in the past.</p>

        <h3>Testing</h3>

        <p>Hakim didn&rsquo;t make any missteps or click any incorrect links on the path to the academic evaluation. At the beginning, his cursor initially gravitated towards the student button, but he soon corrected himself to clicked on the login button. On the student menu, his cursor wavered back and forth between the right and left column a few times before he clicked on the program evaluation link. On the options page he quickly peeked into the dropdown menu for changing his program of study, but quickly decided he didn&rsquo;t need it. </p>

        <p>While narrating, he described the program evaluations options page as bland, incarcerating, and suffocating. He found the academic evaluation itself to be clear, but suspected that this was only because he was familiar with it. He noticed that the program summary table on the academic evaluation page didn&rsquo;t have clear horizontals and was hard to read. Overall, he felt the design of WebAdvisor felt &ldquo;floaty&rdquo;.</p>

        <h3>Discussion</h3>

        <p>For the 5 whys, I asked Hakim about why he felt that the design of the pages was suffocating. He said that the colors were washed out and very stagnant, the typography was unenthusiastic, and there were too many boxes and straight horizontal lines. It felt more like a government database website to him than an art school website. Overall, WebAdvisor is dry and uninspiring, which could cause students to feel demotivated and not at all enthusiastic about their education.</p>

        <p>When asked how future technology might affect how WebAdvisor functions, he said that it was probably going to be inaccessible and incompatible with any new technologies in the future.</p>

        <p>When asked to think of a scenario that a person might use the program evaluation in, he said a teacher who is advising a student for registration and needs to look at their progress so far.</p>

        <h2>Subject #4: Monica</h2>

        <p>Monica is a senior currently attending MassArt and majoring in animation. She has extensive experience using DiVinci on both desktop and mobile. She doesn&rsquo;t consider herself very tech-savvy.</p>

        <h3>Testing</h3>

        <p>At the beginning of testing, Monica accidentally typed in the wrong url, taking her to a completely different website. When she reached DaVinci, the site was extremely small, and she had to zoom in to hit the &ldquo;tiny buttons&rdquo;. She went to the Student menu first, then went to login. When finding the program evaluation link, she had to zoom in very far and be very careful about pressing the correct link. </p>

        <p>On the program evaluation options page, she expressed confusion about why she had to check that radio button when there was only one option for it to work. She also complained about the wait. On the program evaluation page, one of her electives was filed under the wrong category. Some of the text was so small, it was impossible to read. She had to zoom in again to log out, and the page wasn&rsquo;t always responsive to her gestures. </p>

        <h3>Discussion</h3>

        <p>For the 5 whys, I asked Monica about why she had to zoom in to press the buttons. The buttons are too small and close together for normal sized fingers to press accurately. This is inconvenient when you accidentally press the wrong button, or worse, accidentally log out. After that you need to do things all over again, and it&rsquo;s very inconvenient. She wants to be able to finish as fast and with the least number of steps possible so that she can get what she needs in a timely manner. </p>

        <p>When asked how future technology might affect how WebAdvisor functions, she said that WebAdvisor needs to catch up to 2016 technology standards before even thinking about the future, especially on mobile. </p>

        <p>When asked to think of a scenario that a person might use the program evaluation in, she said a student who is checking out what classes they need in preparation for an advisor meeting.  </p>
        
        <h2>Informance Insights</h2>
        <p>While walking other people thorugh the process of finding the program evaluation, I found many things that I personally had a problem with an wanted to fix.</p>
        <p>The language used across WebAdvisor is inconsistent. In different places, the program evaluation is called a program evaluation, an academic evaluation, and a degree audit. This is confusing, and none of the names give a good indication of what you are looking at.</p>
        <p>The login button needs to be higher in the hierarchy on the front page. I always mistakenly click on student menu first, which is colored, larger, and on a more visible part of the page.</p>
        <p>On mobile, the layout is inconsistant across browsers. The program evaluation page looks different on Monica's windows phone than on my iPhone. They only made the warning about auto-capitalization mobile friendly, but they only did by making it huge. They put in on the desktop version too, leading me to believe they have no mobile exclusive functionality at all.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <h2>Strategy for Fixing WebAdvisor</h2>
        
        <p>If WebAdvisor is to be a successful program, it will need to function well on any device that modern students are likely to be using. For my solution I will be focusing on mobile devices, because that is the area where WebAdvisor is most lacking. </p>

        <p>Overall, WebAdvisor had the most problems in four areas: unintuitive navigation, a lack of hierarchy, confusing language, and a dullness to its aesthetic that isn&rsquo;t fit for an art school. </p>

        <p>To fix the navigation, I will use familiar mobile navigation schemes such as tab bar. Popular, often utilized functions such as the transcript, program evaluation, and class registration will be emphasized, while less popular functions will fade into the background. The highest priority navigation items will change contextually based on the time of year. For example, the program evaluation and class registration options would be most prominent during registration times, while the class schedule and transcript will take their place other times.</p>

        <p>The hierarchy problem will be solved partially by the methods discussed for navigation, and partially by better typographic choices. Important information, such as class names, credits and grades, will given more visual weight than unimportant things such as class codes. I will also reduce visual confusion by allowing the user to filter their program evaluation to show only relevant types of classes. For example, only viewing what they need for junior year, only incomplete classes, et cetera.</p>

        <p>The language in many parts of the workflow will be improved. Buttons prompting the user to continue will have language that makes sense. In some places, icon will be used to supplement or even replace words to make the process easier to understand. I will also be changing the name of the program evaluation to something clearer that better represents what the user wants out of it, which is checking their progress towards their degree. In my app it will be called an &ldquo;academic progress report.&rdquo; </p>

        <p>Finally, the overall look of WebAdvisor will be improved, to make it both more beautiful and more friendly looking. A pleasant and soothing color scheme will encourage happiness in users, or at least keep them from getting too stressed while they try to navigate through the class registration process. Because art schools are filled with visual learners, I will experiment with representing their progress graphically to help them understand where they are in working towards their degree. </p>

        <h3>An Example User Experience</h3>

        <p>When the user opens DaVinci, they will immediately be met with a login screen. After logging in they will be brought to a main menu. Popular and relevant links will be at the top, while less important links will be further down if you scroll. The absolute most important links will be available in the tab bar, as well as a link back to the menu screen.</p>

        <p>The user presses on the Progress Report link. They are given the option to view the report for their major, or for another major. Next, they can choose to see their entire progress report, or a segment of it filtered by semester, class type (foundation, major requirement, elective, etc.), or completion status. There is also an advanced filtering option if they want a more targeted search.</p>

        <p>Let&rsquo;s say they decide to filter by semester, and just see their freshman spring requirements. It will give them an update on how many more credits they need from this segment, along with a graphical representation, such as a progress bar or pie chart. Beneath it will be tabs for different class types, structured similarly to the current program evaluation page but with better hierarchy and white space. These tabs will be collapsable if the user doesn&rsquo;t want to view a certain class type.</p>

        <p>If the user wants to filter their results more specifically, they can click on the filters button. Then they will be able to set the semesters, class types, and completion statuses they&rsquo;re looking for.</p>
